# Go Wink MQTT

Go Wink MQTT is a reimplementation of the work done by danielolson13 on [wink-mqtt](https://github.com/danielolson13/wink-mqtt) in Golang. 

This project started from a personal need. I updated my Wink Hub to the latest version of the firmware only to find that Wink MQTT did not support that firmware
version. On top of that, it had been mentioned that the project was dead. Having a desire to hook my Wink Hub up to my Homeassistant box,
I got to work on trying to reimplement and improve upon the wonderful work that had already been done. 

The reason for Go? I personally love Go, and I felt like the low memory footprint and compiled nature of Go would 
help the project to run more efficiently on the Wink Hub with its limited resources.
